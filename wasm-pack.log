error: failed to extract wasm-bindgen custom sections
	caused by: 

it looks like the Rust project used to create this wasm file was linked against
a different version of wasm-bindgen than this binary:

  rust wasm file: 0.2.15
     this binary: 0.2.16

Currently the bindgen format is unstable enough that these two version must
exactly match, so it's required that these two version are kept in sync by
either updating the wasm-bindgen dependency or this binary. You should be able
to update the wasm-bindgen dependency with:

    cargo update -p wasm-bindgen

or you can update the binary with

    cargo install -f wasm-bindgen-cli

if this warning fails to go away though and you're not sure what to do feel free
to open an issue at https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues!
